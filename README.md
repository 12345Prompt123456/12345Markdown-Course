# SpiderLang
Code faster, not harder 

```spider
import textdash from spiderlangINTERPRETER;

textdash.pop("Hi!");
```
Also the pop statement is to pop it into the console just like popcorn! 🍿. <br><br>
Everytime you start a new program, you need a ```import textdash from spiderlangINTERPRETER;``` statementor else you msut type thiswhole line of code to print Hi:
```spider
spider.createTextOnConsole("Hi", baseInterpreter)
```
Imagine this, it is just like python if you are a pro at python then you are a pro at SpiderLang. Now to make a simple window type this:
```spider
import Spiderwindow from spiderlangINTERPRETER;

Spiderwindow.pop.up();
```
Since ```Spiderwindow.pop.up();``` requires no positional arguments you don't need any parameters
